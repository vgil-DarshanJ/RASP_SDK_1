     * `true` when a third-party app holds `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`.

     * ## A real, disclosed limitation — not fixed in this port
     *
     * This walks `PackageManager.getInstalledPackages()` — a **bulk**
     * installed-apps enumeration. On API 30+ package-visibility rules,
     * that call is filtered to only the packages this app can already see
     * (itself, anything declared in `<queries>`, and a small system
     * allowlist) **unless** the app holds the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`
     * permission — a sensitive permission Google Play requires explicit,
     * narrow justification to declare, and this SDK does not request it on
     * a consuming app's behalf (that decision belongs to the app team, not
     * a library). The practical consequence: on a real API 30+ device
     * without that permission, this check is **structurally blind** to
     * most third-party overlay-permission holders — it will typically
     * report `false` regardless of what is actually installed, not
     * because nothing was found but because nothing outside this app's
     * visibility scope could be enumerated at all.
     *
     * Ported unchanged from the pre-extraction implementation, which had
     * the identical limitation — not a regression introduced here. If your
     * threat model requires this signal to actually work on API 30+, the
     * two real options are: request `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` (Play Store
     * policy review required) or corroborate with [RaspScreenGuard]'s
     * `touch_obscured` runtime signal instead, which needs no package
     * visibility at all and is unaffected by this limitation — see
     * [overlayEvidence]'s two-signal design.
