/**
 * The **I/O half** of the hook-detection engine.
 *
 * Reads the evidence [RaspHookAnalysis] classifies: mapped regions, the origin
 * of executable mappings, and the runtime's own view of security-critical
 * methods. Takes a [Context] rather than an `Activity` for the same reason as
 * [RaspDeviceProbes] — so instrumentation tests can call the real production
 * implementation with nothing mocked.
 *
 * ## Method integrity: the minimum viable set
 *
 * [criticalMethodSignals] does **not** walk every class in the app. Protecting
 * everything blindly costs startup time on the scan path and produces noise;
 * the set below is limited to methods where a successful hook would let an
 * attacker change a decision that actually matters:
 *
 * | Method | What a hook would achieve |
 * |---|---|
 * | `RaspDeviceProbes.isFridaDetected` | suppress instrumentation detection |
 * | `RaspDeviceProbes.isDebuggerAttached` | suppress debugger detection |
 * | `RaspHookProbes.isHookingDetected` | suppress hook detection itself |
 * | `RaspSignalAnalysis.fridaVerdict` | invert the instrumentation verdict |
 * | `RaspSignalAnalysis.debuggerVerdict` | invert the debugger verdict |
 * | `RaspHookAnalysis.hookVerdict` | invert the hook verdict |
 *
 * These are the native-side equivalents of the licence/binding/policy
 * functions named in the security brief. The licence handshake, device binding
 * and signing-certificate checks are enforced **server-side** as well
 * (`/api/v1/sdk/activate` recomputes the HMAC and compares the pinned
 * fingerprint), so a client-side hook on those cannot by itself mint a valid
 * activation — which is why the client-side integrity budget is spent here, on
 * the detectors whose verdicts have no server-side equivalent.
 *
 * ## Why "is it native?" is the check
 *
 * Java-level hooking frameworks in the Xposed/YAHFA/Epic family replace a
 * method's entry point, after which ART reports the method as `native`. A
 * normally-compiled Kotlin function is never `native`, so observing that flag
 * on one of the methods above is observing the hook's own mechanism rather
 * than an artefact it left behind.
 *
 * ## Unavailable is not "clean"
 *
 * If reflection cannot resolve a method — obfuscation renamed it, a future
 * Kotlin release changed the signature — the result is
 * [MethodIntegrity.UNAVAILABLE], never `INTACT`. Reporting "no hook found"
 * for a check that never ran is exactly the failure mode the SDK's four-state
 * `DetectionStatus` exists to prevent.
