/**
 * Classification logic and signal data for root detection.
 *
 * ## Extraction, not redesign
 *
 * Every path, package name, predicate and threshold here is a **verbatim move**
 * from `MainActivity.rootSignals()`. No signal was added, removed, weakened or
 * reordered. The detection algorithm is unchanged; only its location is.
 *
 * ## Why the split
 *
 * Root detection was the SDK's strongest native code and its least verified —
 * it had no test of any kind, because the logic lived in a `private fun` on a
 * `FlutterActivity` where nothing could reach it. Separating the *deciding*
 * from the *reading* makes the decisions testable on any JVM, exactly as
 * [RaspSignalAnalysis] and [RaspHookAnalysis] already are.
 *
 * ```
 *   RaspDeviceIntegrityProbes — reads evidence  (needs a device)
 *   RaspRootAnalysis          — decides meaning (pure; this file)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Verdict model: deliberately different from the emulator detector
 *
 * [isRooted] is `isNotEmpty()` — **any** signal convicts. That asymmetry
 * against [RaspEmulatorAnalysis.isEmulator] is intentional and predates this
 * extraction: a `su` binary or a Magisk artefact has no innocent explanation on
 * a retail handset, whereas `Build.MANUFACTURER == "unknown"` genuinely does.
 * Preserved as-is.
