/**
 * Classification logic for the hook-detection engine.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a signature list
 *
 * The cheap version of hook detection is "does package `de.robv.android.xposed`
 * exist?" — one name, one lookup, defeated by renaming or by any of the
 * hiding modules that ship with modern LSPosed. That is the same single-point
 * failure the Frida detector was rebuilt to escape, so this engine follows the
 * same rule: **several independent signal families, correlated, none of them
 * individually sufficient unless it is genuinely hard to forge.**
 *
 * The families here are deliberately different in kind, so that defeating one
 * says nothing about the others:
 *
 * | Family | What it observes | Forgery cost |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `hook_framework_lib` | a framework's own library mapped into this process | moderate — the SONAME is not the filename |
 * | `hook_native_method` | a Java method that should be interpreted is now `native` | **high** — it is the hook's own mechanism |
 * | `hook_suspicious_lib_path` | code mapped from a writable/temp location | moderate |
 * | `hook_rwx_mapping` | writable **and** executable memory | low on its own — JIT does this legitimately |
 *
 * `hook_native_method` is the load-bearing one. Java-level hooking frameworks
 * in the Xposed/YAHFA/Epic family work by replacing a method's entry point,
 * which the runtime then reports as `native`. Observing that is observing the
 * hook itself rather than an artefact it happened to leave behind, so renaming
 * the framework does not help an attacker.
 *
 * ## Pure by construction
 *
 * No Android imports, no I/O — same split as [RaspSignalAnalysis]. The reading
 * lives in [RaspDeviceProbes]; this decides what the readings mean, and is
 * therefore testable on any JVM.
