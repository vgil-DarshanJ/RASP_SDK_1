/**
 * Xposed/LSPosed, Magisk manager, Lucky Patcher, GameGuardian, and similar
 * tampering-framework/installer packages — verbatim port of
 * `RaspSecurityChannelHandler.hasReverseEngineeringTools()`.
 *
 * ## A real bug fixed during this port
 *
 * The pre-extraction manifest declared `<queries>` for only 2 of these 9
 * packages, and one of those 2 was the wrong exact name (the Xposed
 * *framework* package, not the Xposed *Installer app* package this check
 * actually targets). On API 30+ package-visibility rules, a package
 * `PackageManager` is not told about via `<queries>` is invisible — not
 * "reported as absent," genuinely unqueryable — regardless of whether it
 * is installed. The check was silently blind to 7 of its 9 targets on
 * every device running a modern Android version. Fixed at the manifest
 * (`android_core/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`), which is the actual
 * mechanism Android provides for this — not worked around in code.
